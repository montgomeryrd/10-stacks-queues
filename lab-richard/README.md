<h1>Lab 10 Stacks and Queues</h1>

<h2>Node Module</h2>
The Node Module uses a class constructor to instantiate a node that takes in a value as its argument.

<h2>Stack Module</h2>
The Stack Module uses a class constructor to instantiate a stack data structure using two main prototype methods: push() and pop(). A third method, peek(), let's us see what is currently on the top of the stack. The stack has a maximum size of 1337 and follows a LIFO method: Last in, First out.

<strong>push():</strong> The push method is used to add an element to the top the stack. Pushing a node to the stack will increment the size of the stack by one each time.
<strong>pop():</strong> The pop method is used to remove an element from the top of the stack. Removing an element will decrement the size of the stack by one each time.

<h2>Queue Module</h2>
The Queue Module uses a class constructor to instantiate a queue data stucture using two main prototype methods as well: enqueue() and dequeue(). A third method, peek(), let's us see what is currently at the front of the queue. The queue also has a maximum size of 1337 and follows a FIFO method: First in, First out.

<strong>enqueue():</strong> The enqueue method is used to add an element to the back of the queue. Adding a node to the queue will increment the size of the queue by once each time.
<strong>dequeue():</strong> The dequeue method is used to remove an element from the front of the queue. Removing an element will decrement the size of the queue by one each time.
